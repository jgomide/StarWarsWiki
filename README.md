# Event App - Angular / C# .Net Core Project

***project under development***

A WEB APP Project using Angular and .NET tenologies. In order to keep learning more about the enviroment and how the server-side comunicate with the client-side I did a step forward to get this two guys talking together. I'm curious to see how JWT link the comunication between the front-end and back-end.

To build this App and Web Api solution I used Entity Framework with Migration to interact with SQL Express Database. I am also implementing JWT to create a register/login for this App. 



## Technologies used

* [ASP.NET CORE REST API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/apis). 
* [Angular 9](https://angular.io/). 
* [Migrations Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli). 
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/about/). 
* [JWT](https://jwt.io/). 

```bash

```

## Installation

### Changes you need to do

* Clone or download the project 

In order to execute this App from anywhere in my local network I put some not recommendable static 
information. So you need to make some small changes.

In the file: 
`
..\AngularDotNetProject\Angular-app\src\app\_services\Event.service.ts`

Change the baseURL variable for the name of the computer you are using to host the app/server
`
baseURL = 'http://<NAME-OF-YOUR-COMPUTER>:5002/api/event'
`

### Running 

* Back-end: run with command line 'dotnet run' in the .net project directory  
* Front-end: run with command line 'ng-serve' in the angular project directory
